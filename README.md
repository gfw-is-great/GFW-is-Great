# GFW-is-Great
Why must we have GFW (Great Fire Wall) in China? Why do we have to block Google outside? Why do we have to ban illegal VPN services?!

有些人总是有疑问，为什么我们中国的互联网有GFW防火墙？

为什么谷歌在我国被屏蔽？

为什么我们严惩那些贩卖和使用违法VPN的人士？

那些就让我们来告诉你为什么我们国家要有墙，为什么我们要屏蔽谷歌，为什么我们要打击违法VPN！

Some people always have questions like these: Why must we Chinese have a GFW firewall?

Why is Google blocked in our country?

Why do we severely punish those who sell or use illegal VPNs?

Now it’s the time. Let us tell you why our country must have GFW, why we must block Google, why we have to crack down on illegal VPN!

境外中文网站总有种观点，以为自由的网络是不应该有墙的，以为我们政府造墙是为了愚弄民众，以为我们政府是邪恶的。他们总是煽动我们，他们希望我们翻墙看到他们想说的，他们希望我们推翻墙推翻政府。

There is always a view in the Western dominated cyberspace that internet should be free (information freedom) and there shouldn’t be any walls. They think that our Chinese government is evil to build the GFW. They assume our government is a tyrannical dictator and the GFW is used to fool the people and monitoring the people like the 1984. So they always shake us, they want us to overthrow the government, and they want us to cross the GFW to read what they want to say.

实在是看不惯这些智障言论了！让我们来告诉你为什么我们国家要有GFW（Great FIre Wall）防火墙，为什么我们要屏蔽谷歌，为什么我们要打击违法VPN！

THESE VIEWS ARE COMPLETELY WRONG!!

WE ARE REALLY FED UP BY THOUSE STUPID SPEECHES!!

Let us tell you why our country has a GFW (Great Fire Wall) firewall, why do we want to block Google, why do we want to crack down on illegal VPNs!

有些人利用境外那些网站传播反动言论，色情内容，比如博讯大纪元草榴社区等等。然而按照我们的法律，这些网站是应该被关闭的。

The reason is simple. Some people use websites outside our country to spread reactionary speeches and pornography contents. These people created websites such as the Boxun (博讯), the Epoch Times (大纪元) and T66Y (草榴). They also use Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube to spread such contents. However, according to our laws, spreading these contents must be blocked.

> 智障言论1，有些人被境外组织洗脑，认为这些内容的网站不该被关。
>
> Stupid speech 1. Some people may argue that these contents should not be blocked. They say that these contents are not blocked in the West. They may also pop up with some online surveys saying that some Chinese netizens like these contents.

这种言论显然不对，去问问我国多数人是不是认为要关这些内容，不要光听网上的

This kind of speech is obviously wrong. We Chinese have to listen to our people not listen to the West! Also, we can’t just listen to the Internet users of our people, we have to listen to the majority of our people. Online surveys are meaningless, ask our people from door to door to see whether they like those contents or not!!

> 智障言论2，有些人想挑拨离间，认为封锁境外网站是政府想要维持自身的统治。
>
> Stupid speech 2. Some people want to provoke dissension, that the blockade of these websites is the Chinese government wants to maintain its own rule (not for the Chinese people’s interest).

这种人只会轻信境外反动媒体，丝毫看不到我国政府和我党带领人民闹革命站起来了，带领我们拥有核武器成为世界大国，还带领1.2亿人脱贫致富！在当前特朗普打贸易战的当下，美国想要撸走我们的利益，显然是我国政府在维护我们国家的利益！！
但是谷歌却不尊重我们不认同我国的法律，谷歌不管这些内容**不删除**这些内容！那么该咋办？？除了封锁他们还有啥办法？？

These stupid people only read the Western reactionary media. They did not see that it is our Communist Party and the Chinese government who have led the Chinese people to take the revolution in the 1930s and stand up. It is just under our Chinese government’s correct leadership, we had possessed the nuclear weapons. It is our Chinese government who had led 120 million people to get rid of poverty and become rich! At this moment when Donald Trump is fighting trade war with us, the United States wants to take away our money. Obviously, it is our government who is protecting the interests of our people!!

So clearly, blocking those reactionary speeches and pornography contents is the interest of the majority of the Chinese people. And our government is representing us doing the right thing.

But those Western companies don’t understand. They don’t block those illegal contents even after we request them to do. For example, the evil Google does not respect us and does not agree with our laws. Google **does not delete** those contents! They call it by a good name “freedom of speech” but they are actually **help spreading those illegal contents**. So what can we do?? Other than blocking them, is there any other way??

> 智障言论3，有些人被洗脑，以为谷歌是为了维护言论自由。他们甚至拿出宪法说，违反了宪法第三十五条“中华人民共和国公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由。”
> 
> Stupid speech 3. Some Chinese netizens are brainwashed, they think that Google is to maintain freedom of speech. They even took out the Chinese Constitution and said that blocking it violated Article 35 of the Constitution. “Citizens of the People’s Republic of China have the freedom to speak, publish, assemble, associate, march, and demonstrate

这种人并没有学透宪法，他们忽略了我国宪法第五十一条：中华人民共和国公民在行使自由和权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利。
事实就是这种反动言论有可能造成社会动荡，危害我国的安全稳定，影响了我国人民生存和发展的权力和自由！
所以我们当然要封锁他们，但是有些人利用违法VPN偷偷访问那些网站，该怎么办？？当然就要举报那些违法VPN！！

Such stupid people did not learn all the Constitution. They have neglected Article 51 of our Constitution: “Citizens of the People’s Republic of China must not harm the national, social, and collective interests and the legitimate freedoms of other citizens when exercising their freedom and rights.”The fact is that such reactionary speeches may cause social unrest, endanger China’s security and stability, and affect the right our people’s survival and development!

So of course, we have to block those illegal contents, but there are still some people use illegal VPNs to secretly visit those websites. what should we do?? Of course, we must crack down those illegal VPNs!!

> 智障言论4，有些人不了解我国政策，以为我国屏蔽所有的VPN是愚民政策。
> 
> Stupid speech 4. Some people do not understand China’s policies, thinking that it is a foolish policy to blocking all VPNs.

这些人对我国政策一知半解危言耸听，他们不知道我国工信部出台的《关于清理规范互联网网络接入服务市场的通知》，我国工信部早已说过，对于“一些外贸企业、跨国企业因办公自用等原因，需要通过VPN等方式跨境联网时，可以向依法设置国际通信出入口局申请合法资质”。我们要打击的是那些违法VPN，而不是合法VPN。

Stupid speech 4. Some people do not understand China’s policies, thinking that it is a foolish policy to blocking all VPNs.
These stupid people are ignorant of our policy, and they do not know the “Notice on Clearing and Regulating the Internet Access Service Market”(《关于清理规范互联网网络接入服务市场的通知》) issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (MIIT). The MIIT has already said that “Some foreign trade enterprises and multinational enterprises need to use VPNs for reasons such as office use. They can apply for legally qualified VPNs. What we are going to strike is those illegal VPNs, not the legitimate VPNs.”

有了这些知识，我们就可以很容易应对一些智障的挑衅言论，比如：

With this knowledge, we can easily deal with some stupid provocative questions raised by some brainwashed Chinese netizens, such as:

> 智障言论5，为什么人民日报、环球时报的编辑能上推特，而我上不了？
> 
> Stupid speech 5. “Why do editors of the People’s Daily and the Global Times can push on Twitter, but I can’t get on?”

我国人民日报、环球时报是合法访问境外网站的，就是靠有资质的VPN懂了吗？？！
作为个人，如果你在正规单位，比如人民日报、环球时报、还有各大科研院所，互联网企业等，你可以问你的领导要！如果他们不懂，就引导他们去工信部和各地通信管理局去申请合法资质！
如果你的领导不给你合法VPN，就说明你的工作没必要访问境外网站懂了吗？

The editors of the People’s Daily and the Global Times are legally visiting overseas websites because they use qualified VPNs!
If you don’t have a qualified VPN, you can’t!
As an individual, if you are in a enterprise that require such services like the People’s Daily, Global Times, Internet companies, and major research institutes, etc., you can ask your manger to apply for qualified VPN!
If your leader does not give you a legitimate VPN, it means that your work does not need to visit the such overseas websites.

所以还有人有疑问吗？大家应该都认同了吧，我们就是要打击那些违法VPN！那些没有资质的VPN, SS, V2RAY, VPS之类的都该被举报！举报给我国的网信办网警！！

Who are we? We jvbao group (jvbao举报) is a group of advocators that calls for reporting illegal VPNs to internet police!!

So is there anyone still having questions? Everyone should agree, we must crack down on those illegal VPN! Those unqualified VPNs, SS, V2RAY, VPS and the like should be reported!
